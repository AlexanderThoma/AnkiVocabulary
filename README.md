# Anki card generation by using AI

The prompt in `./generateVocabularyPrompt.txt` will generate a CSV ready to be imported to a Anki deck.
A sample of the Anki deck is attached (`./ankiDeck.apkg`)

The recordings for the cards are generated using Azure Speech Service by utilizing the HyperTTS addon.
